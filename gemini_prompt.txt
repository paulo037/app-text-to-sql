Instruction:
You will be provided with a user question, the schema of a database along with two sample rows from each table.
Your task is to transform the provided SQL query into a chain of thought, with the final step being the SQL query itself. This chain of thought should clearly explain the reasoning process step-by-step.

Input:
User Question: {question}
Schema:
{schema}

Final SQL Query:
```sql

```

### Example (Note that the user's question may require a different number of steps):
User Question: What are the names of all employees in the 'Sales' department?
Schema:

CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  department_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);

/*
2 rows from employees table:
employee_id  first_name  last_name  department_id
1            John         Doe          2
2            Jane         Smith        1
*/

CREATE TABLE departments (
  department_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name TEXT NOT NULL
);


/*
2 rows from departments table:
department_id  department_name
1               Sales
2               Engineering
*/


### Chain of Thought:
1. Identify the relevant tables needed to answer the question. In this case, we need information from the 'employees' and 'departments' tables.
2. Determine the necessary columns to include in the final output. Here, we need 'first_name' and 'last_name' from the 'employees' table.
3. Understand the condition specified in the question, which is to filter employees by the 'Sales' department. This means we need to filter rows in the 'departments' table where 'department_name' equals 'Sales'.
4. Establish the connection between the 'employees' and 'departments' tables. This is done using the 'department_id' column present in both tables.
5. Formulate the SQL query by selecting the desired columns and applying the necessary join and filter conditions.

Final SQL Query: 

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE d.department_name = 'Sales';
```

### Now, it's your turn:
