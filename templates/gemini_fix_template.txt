Instruction:
You will be provided with a user question, the schema of a database along with two sample rows from each table, the SQL code previous produced, and finally the sqlite error.
Your task is to fix the provided SQL query using a chain of thought, with the final step being the Corrected SQL query itself. This chain of thought should clearly explain the reasoning process step-by-step.

Input:
User Question: {question}
Schema:
{schema}

SQL Query with Errors:
```sql
{predicted}
```

Sqlite Error:
```python
{error}
```


### Example (Note that the user's question may require a different number of steps):
User Question: What are the names of all employees in the 'Sales' department?
Schema:

CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  department_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);

/*
2 rows from employees table:
employee_id  first_name  last_name  department_id
1            John         Doe          2
2            Jane         Smith        1
*/

CREATE TABLE departments (
  department_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name TEXT NOT NULL
);


/*
2 rows from departments table:
department_id  department_name
1               Sales
2               Engineering
*/


SQL Query with Errors:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_name = 'Sales';
```

Sqlite Error:
```python
no such column: department_name
```

### Chain of Thought to Fix the Query:

1. **Identify the tables involved:** 
   - The `employees` table contains the employees' first and last names.
   - The `departments` table contains the department names.

2. **Analyze the incorrect SQL:**
   - The `employees` table does not have a `department_name` column.
   - We need to use the `department_id` to join the `employees` table with the `departments` table.

3. **Determine the correct relationship:**
   - The `department_id` in the `employees` table should match the `department_id` in the `departments` table.
   - We need to filter the results where `department_name` is 'Sales'.

4. **Construct the JOIN clause:**
   - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `employees` and `departments` tables on the `department_id`.

Final SQL Query: 

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE d.department_name = 'Sales';
```

### Now, it's your turn:

User Question: {question}

SQL Query with Errors:

Sqlite Error:
